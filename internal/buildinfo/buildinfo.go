// Package buildinfo holds the binary's build identity (version, commit,

// (rather than cmd/fastclaw/main) so internal/* code — notably the agent

// into a dependency loop.

// as "no published version" rather than a real release.

// IsHostedDeploy reports whether this fastclaw process is running in a
// hosted/multi-tenant deployment (cloud) versus a self-hosted single-
// operator install. Driven by the FASTCLAW_DEPLOY env var:
//
//	FASTCLAW_DEPLOY=hosted        → IsHostedDeploy() == true
//	FASTCLAW_DEPLOY=self-hosted   → false
//	(unset or anything else)      → false (default = self-hosted)
//
// Operators set this in their cloud deployment manifests (k8s
// values.yaml, docker-compose env, …). Default-self-hosted matches
// the most common case (developer running fastclaw on their own
// laptop) and avoids surprising upgrade prompts when an operator
// just forgets the env var on their cloud deploy — better to
// default to "tell the user how to upgrade" and only suppress when
// explicitly opted in.
//
// Read each call (not cached) so a config-edit + sighup flow can
// flip it without a process restart, though in practice it's set
// once at boot.

// operator has explicitly opted in via FASTCLAW_ALLOW_HOST_EXEC=1
// (or "true"/"yes") AND this isn't a hosted multi-tenant deploy.
//
// Default OFF. Earlier versions registered host_exec for every
// self-hosted install — a too-permissive default that exposed the
// operator's host shell to ANY external IM user (WeChat, Discord,
// Feishu, …) the agent was reachable from. With the new gate, an
// operator who actually needs host_exec (single-user laptop dev
// flow, `fastclaw upgrade`, `~/Downloads` triage) sets the env var
// at deploy time; everyone else gets the safer sandbox-or-nothing
// behavior.
